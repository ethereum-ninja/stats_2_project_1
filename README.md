# Possible Data Sources:
   
   Sample: https://fantasydata.com/nfl/fantasy-football-leaders?season=2014&seasontype=1&scope=2&subscope=1&startweek=1&endweek=1&aggregatescope=1&range=1
   
   
 ## Root Url:  https://fantasydata.com/nfl/fantasy-football-leaders
  
  ## API Params:
   - season=2014
   - seasontype=1 (pre/post/regular?)
   - scope=2. (???)
   - subscope=1 (???)
   - startweek=1
   - endweek=1
   - aggregatescope=11 (how does this work?)
   - range=1
    
 Permute the years/weeks and scrape the weekly data
 
 (check how aggregation parameters work for the API - if we can't get individual games, then we can infer the 
 game stats from the diff of each set)
