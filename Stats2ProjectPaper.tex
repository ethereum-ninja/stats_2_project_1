\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Fantasy sports are a big business. Generating nearly 7 billion dollars
annually (cite) and with approximately 60 million players in the
US/Canada (cite), fantasy sports -- particularly football -- have become
as big as the sports that they mimic. Players can compete head to head
in leagues across a wide range of providers (Yahoo, CBS, ESPN,
DraftKings, DraftStreet etc) -- each with their own rulesets and stakes.
Some are just friendly leagues set up between friends or coworkers, no
real stakes other than bragging rights, others have significant monetary
rewards for those that can get to the top of the leaderboard.

The explosion of weekly leagues over the course of the last few years
has seen an already huge business get even larger. In the weekly cash
leagues -- each player is given a budget and drafts a completely new
team every week. Each draft site uses a predictive model to set player
salaries based on the number of points the model predicts that player to
score. Budget constraints make it impossible to simply select the
players that are predicted to score the most points -- hence having a
predictive model for which players will generate the best return on
investment would be a huge advantage. In the following analysis we will
attempt to build position specific models that can accurately predict
the number of points a given NFL player is likely to score in a given
week.

\section{Objective One}\label{objective-one}

\subsection{Model Selection}\label{model-selection}

\subsubsection{Type of Selection}\label{type-of-selection}

Of the tools made available to us in the course, we believe that LASSO
estimation is the best option available to us. Subset selection
discretely adds and removes variables, leaving far too much room for
overfitting. While ridge regression is a great shrinkage method for many
scenarios, we believe that it is at least slightly desirable for the
coefficients of truly unnecessary variables to actually be zero so that
some true form of variable selection is occurring. We are implicitly
saying that a small set of variables are necessary to predict fantasy
scores, but the nature of football, the size of our dataset, and the
disproportionate amount of points that goes to touchdowns indicates that
this assumptions may very well be appropriate.

\subsubsection{Assumption-Checking}\label{assumption-checking}

The LASSO model is a linear model and thus assumes that there is a
linear relationship between the response and the parameters.
Furthermore, it is also important that the variance of the residuals is
constant across the predictors in order for our model to adequately
capture the variation in the response. Because we are not interested in
quantifying our uncertainty, we don't make any assumptions about the
distribution of the residuals.
